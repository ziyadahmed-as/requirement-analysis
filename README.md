## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** (also known as requirements engineering) is the structured process of **eliciting, analyzing, validating, and documenting** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software product.  

It ensures that both the development team and the stakeholders share a **common understanding** of what the system should achieve, minimizing ambiguity and preventing costly misunderstandings later in the project.  

In simple terms:  
üëâ Requirement Analysis defines **what needs to be built** before moving on to **how it will be built**.

## Objectives of Requirement Analysis

The key objectives are to:  
1. **Identify Stakeholder Needs** ‚Äì Understand the goals, problems, and expectations of users and clients.  
2. **Translate Needs into Requirements** ‚Äì Convert business problems into precise, technical requirements.  
3. **Establish a Common Language** ‚Äì Create clear documentation that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.  
4. **Prevent Scope Creep** ‚Äì Define project boundaries to avoid uncontrolled changes.  
5. **Provide a Basis for Design & Testing** ‚Äì Ensure that developers know what to build, and testers know what to validate.

## Types of Requirements

Requirement Analysis typically deals with the following categories:  

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  Define specific features and behaviors of the system.  
  Example: ‚ÄúThe system shall allow users to log in with an email and password.‚Äù  

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  Define the quality attributes and performance measures.  
  Example: ‚ÄúThe system should handle 1,000 concurrent users with less than 2 seconds response time.‚Äù  

- **Business Requirements:**  
  High-level objectives from the business perspective.  
  Example: ‚ÄúThe platform should increase online sales by 20% within the first year.‚Äù  

- **User Requirements:**  
  Describe what end-users expect to achieve with the system.  
  Example: ‚ÄúUsers should be able to track the status of their orders in real-time.‚Äù  

- **System Requirements:**  
  Technical details that specify the system‚Äôs architecture, hardware, or integration needs.

## Steps in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is not a one-time task but an **iterative process**. It generally includes the following steps:  

1. **Requirement Elicitation:**  
   Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, observation, brainstorming, or workshops with stakeholders.  

2. **Requirement Analysis & Modeling:**  
   Breaking down gathered requirements, identifying conflicts, and modeling them using diagrams (e.g., UML, use cases, data flow diagrams).  

3. **Requirement Documentation:**  
   Creating a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) that formally describes all requirements.  

4. **Requirement Validation:**  
   Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and aligned with business goals.  

5. **Requirement Management:**  
   Continuously tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

## Importance in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis is essential because:  
- üîπ It reduces project risks by clarifying expectations early.  
- üîπ It prevents costly rework by identifying issues before coding starts.  
- üîπ It improves communication between stakeholders and developers.  
- üîπ It ensures that the final software meets real-world needs.  
- üîπ It provides a **roadmap** for design, development, and testing.  

Without proper requirement analysis, projects often suffer from:  
- Misunderstood objectives.  
- Frequent changes in scope (scope creep).  
- Budget and time overruns.  
- Low-quality software that fails to meet user needs.  

---

## Conclusion

Requirement Analysis acts as the **foundation of successful software projects**. By clearly defining, documenting, and validating requirements, development teams can deliver solutions that are:  
- Technically feasible,  
- Cost-effective, and  
- Fully aligned with business and user expectations.  


# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built. Clearly defining and understanding requirements ensures that the development process is aligned with stakeholder expectations, avoids costly mistakes, and increases the likelihood of project success.  

Below are the key reasons why Requirement Analysis is important:

---

## 1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Miscommunication  
Requirement Analysis ensures that stakeholders, clients, and developers share a common understanding of the project‚Äôs objectives.  
- By documenting **clear and precise requirements**, the chances of ambiguity or conflicting interpretations are greatly reduced.  
- This alignment fosters better collaboration between all parties involved in the project.  

---

## 2. Saves Time and Cost  
Identifying and fixing requirement-related issues early in the SDLC is far less expensive than addressing them during or after implementation.  
- A well-executed analysis phase minimizes **rework** and accelerates development.  
- It ensures optimal use of resources by avoiding unnecessary changes later in the project.  

---

## 3. Improves Quality and Customer Satisfaction  
When requirements are thoroughly analyzed, validated, and aligned with business goals, the final product is more likely to meet customer expectations.  
- This leads to **higher product quality** and improved usability.  
- A well-defined process results in greater customer satisfaction and long-term trust in the solution delivered.  

---

## 4. Acts as a Baseline for Project Planning  
Requirement Analysis provides the foundation for creating realistic **project plans, timelines, and budgets**.  
- It allows project managers to allocate resources effectively.  
- Developers can design solutions that align with both **functional and non-functional requirements**.  

---

## 5. Reduces Project Risks  
By identifying potential challenges, constraints, and dependencies early in the process, Requirement Analysis helps **mitigate risks**.  
- Risks are proactively managed rather than discovered late in the development cycle.  
- This results in smoother execution and fewer unexpected obstacles.  

---

## üìå Conclusion  
Requirement Analysis is not just a preliminary step‚Äîit is a **strategic necessity** in software development. By ensuring clarity, saving resources, improving quality, guiding planning, and reducing risks, it sets the stage for building software solutions that truly deliver value.  


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

Requirement Analysis is not limited to understanding what stakeholders want‚Äîit involves a systematic set of activities that ensure the requirements are properly identified, analyzed, documented, and validated. Below are the **five key activities** involved in Requirement Analysis:  

---

## 1. Requirement Gathering  
- Collect information from stakeholders, customers, users, and other sources.  
- Use interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and brainstorming sessions.  
- Focus on understanding **what the client needs** rather than jumping to solutions.  

---

## 2. Requirement Elicitation  
- Engage stakeholders actively to extract both **explicit and implicit needs**.  
- Techniques: workshops, focus groups, observation, prototyping.  
- Address challenges like conflicting requirements and unclear expectations.  

---

## 3. Requirement Documentation  
- Record the gathered requirements in a structured, clear, and concise format.  
- Use **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** documents, user stories, or use cases.  
- Ensure documentation is **understandable** for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  

---

## 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling  
- Examine requirements to ensure they are **feasible, consistent, and complete**.  
- Identify dependencies, constraints, and potential conflicts.  
- Use models such as **data flow diagrams, UML diagrams, and prototypes** to visualize requirements.  

---

## 5. Requirement Validation  
- Verify that requirements align with stakeholder needs and business goals.  
- Conduct **reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections** with stakeholders.  
- Ensure requirements are testable, achievable, and traceable.  

---

## üìå Summary  
The effectiveness of Requirement Analysis depends on how well these five activities are performed. Each step‚Äîgathering, elicitation, documentation, analysis, and validation‚Äîensures that the project is built on a solid foundation, reducing risks and increasing the likelihood of success.  


# Types of Requirements  

Requirement Analysis typically classifies requirements into two main categories: **Functional** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both play a critical role in ensuring the success of a system, as they describe not only what the system should do but also how well it should perform.  

---

## Functional Requirements  
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. They specify the features, behaviors, and services that the system must provide to meet user and business needs.  

### Examples (Booking Management Project)  
- The system shall allow customers to **search for available rooms** based on date, type, and price range.  
- The system shall allow customers to **book a room online** by filling in required details (name, contact, payment).  
- The system shall generate a **unique booking reference number** for each confirmed reservation.  
- The system shall allow administrators to **view, edit, or cancel bookings**.  
- The system shall send an **email or SMS notification** to confirm the booking.  

---

## Non-functional Requirements  
Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** rather than what it does. They describe quality attributes, constraints, and standards that the system must meet.  

### Examples (Booking Management Project)  
- **Performance:** The system should handle at least **500 concurrent booking requests** without degradation.  
- **Security:** All user data, including payment details, must be stored securely using **encryption standards** (e.g., AES-256).  
- **Availability:** The system must maintain **99.9% uptime** to ensure continuous access.  
- **Usability:** The booking process should not take more than **3 steps** from search to confirmation.  
- **Scalability:** The system must be able to support **future expansion** (e.g., multiple hotels or branches).  

---

## üìå Summary  
- **Functional Requirements** = What the system does (features, actions, behaviors).  
- **Non-functional Requirements** = How the system performs (quality, standards, constraints).  
Both are essential in the **Booking Management Project** to ensure it meets user needs while delivering reliability, performance, and security.  
## 5. Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how different users (actors) interact with a system. It identifies the **actors** (e.g., users, administrators) and the **use cases** (functionalities or services) they engage with.  

Use Case Diagrams help in:
- Understanding the functional requirements of a system.
- Clarifying how the system will be used by different stakeholders.
- Providing a high-level overview for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Serving as a foundation for more detailed system design.

### Example: Booking Management System

Below is a Use Case Diagram for a **Booking Management System**.  

- **Actors**:  
  - **Customer**: Makes and manages bookings.  
  - **Admin**: Oversees and manages the system.  

- **Use Cases**:  
  - Register/Login  
  - Search for Available Rooms  
  - Make a Booking  
  - Cancel Booking  
  - View Booking Details  
  - Manage Bookings (Admin)  
  - Generate Reports (Admin)
