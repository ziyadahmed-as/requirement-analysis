# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of **Requirement Analysis**, one of the most critical phases in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

The main objective of this repository is to:  
- Explain the purpose and scope of requirement analysis.  
- Document the steps, techniques, and types of requirements involved.  
- Highlight its importance in ensuring project success.  
- Serve as a reference for students, software engineers, and professionals.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** (also known as requirements engineering) is the structured process of **eliciting, analyzing, validating, and documenting** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software product.  

It ensures that both the development team and the stakeholders share a **common understanding** of what the system should achieve, minimizing ambiguity and preventing costly misunderstandings later in the project.  

In simple terms:  
👉 Requirement Analysis defines **what needs to be built** before moving on to **how it will be built**.

## Objectives of Requirement Analysis

The key objectives are to:  
1. **Identify Stakeholder Needs** – Understand the goals, problems, and expectations of users and clients.  
2. **Translate Needs into Requirements** – Convert business problems into precise, technical requirements.  
3. **Establish a Common Language** – Create clear documentation that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.  
4. **Prevent Scope Creep** – Define project boundaries to avoid uncontrolled changes.  
5. **Provide a Basis for Design & Testing** – Ensure that developers know what to build, and testers know what to validate.

## Types of Requirements

Requirement Analysis typically deals with the following categories:  

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  Define specific features and behaviors of the system.  
  Example: “The system shall allow users to log in with an email and password.”  

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  Define the quality attributes and performance measures.  
  Example: “The system should handle 1,000 concurrent users with less than 2 seconds response time.”  

- **Business Requirements:**  
  High-level objectives from the business perspective.  
  Example: “The platform should increase online sales by 20% within the first year.”  

- **User Requirements:**  
  Describe what end-users expect to achieve with the system.  
  Example: “Users should be able to track the status of their orders in real-time.”  

- **System Requirements:**  
  Technical details that specify the system’s architecture, hardware, or integration needs.

## Steps in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is not a one-time task but an **iterative process**. It generally includes the following steps:  

1. **Requirement Elicitation:**  
   Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, observation, brainstorming, or workshops with stakeholders.  

2. **Requirement Analysis & Modeling:**  
   Breaking down gathered requirements, identifying conflicts, and modeling them using diagrams (e.g., UML, use cases, data flow diagrams).  

3. **Requirement Documentation:**  
   Creating a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) that formally describes all requirements.  

4. **Requirement Validation:**  
   Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and aligned with business goals.  

5. **Requirement Management:**  
   Continuously tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

## Importance in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis is essential because:  
- 🔹 It reduces project risks by clarifying expectations early.  
- 🔹 It prevents costly rework by identifying issues before coding starts.  
- 🔹 It improves communication between stakeholders and developers.  
- 🔹 It ensures that the final software meets real-world needs.  
- 🔹 It provides a **roadmap** for design, development, and testing.  

Without proper requirement analysis, projects often suffer from:  
- Misunderstood objectives.  
- Frequent changes in scope (scope creep).  
- Budget and time overruns.  
- Low-quality software that fails to meet user needs.

## Conclusion

Requirement Analysis acts as the **foundation of successful software projects**. By clearly defining, documenting, and validating requirements, development teams can deliver solutions that are:  
- Technically feasible,  
- Cost-effective, and  
- Fully aligned with business and user expectations.  

It is not just the **first step** in the SDLC but also one of the **most influential factors** in determining the success or failure of a project.
